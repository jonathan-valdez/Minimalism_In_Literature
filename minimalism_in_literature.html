<p>
<p>In the article that follows, I shall discuss Minimalism in literature, beginning by defining the meaning of the term in a literature context. After looking at the attributes associated with minimalist literature, I will briefly discuss its history. The article's theoretical section will include a brief illustrative analysis of minimalist stylistic elements in the play <i> Das wundervolle Zwischending</i> [The Wonderful In-Between], 2005, by German author Martin Heckmann, and of their function and impact from a recipient's perspective.</p>
<p><strong>'Minimalism': a discussion of terminology</strong></p>
<p>When examining the term 'Minimalism', one must differentiate between the varing ways the term is used in different disciplines. The term 'Minimalism' was first used in the visual arts, in dance and in architecture--and, later, in photography. The term acquired a further meaning with the advent of 'minimal music'. The designation 'Minimal Art' (most frequently used in discussions of the USA arts scene during the 1960s and 1970s) can therefore be applied to multiple artistic disciplines. What all definitions of Minimalism have in common is an insistent emphasis on reducing everything to its essentials, thereby producing a certain abstract quality. There are, however, significant differences in the way Minimalism is understood in different artistic disciplines.</p>
<p>The word 'Minimalism' was first used in a literature context in the 1960s, in connection with certain North American short stories--such as Ernest Hemingway's <i>Death in the Afternoon</i>, 1960--and their reception. The author Raymond Carver, with his volume of short stories <i>What we talk about, when we talk about love</i>, 1981, was regarded by contemporary reviewers--and has since been regarded by academic critics--as one of the originators of Minimalism. Initially, there were a number of other terms for this new literary phenomenon, including 'K-Mart realism', 'hick chic','Diet Pepsi Minimalism' and 'post-Vietnam,post-literary,postmodernist blue-collar neo-early-Hemingwayism'.'Minimalism' ultimately became the generally understood term due to the predominantly negative connotations associated with these alternative terms. The 'minimalist' label,however, was initially rejected by authors and criticized by academics. Minimalist literature was summarily dismissed as short reading matter intended for an audience accustomed to television, with no artistic aspirations. Many authors objected emphatically to being classed as 'minimalists'.</p>
<p>The debate on the merits of minimalist literature begain to gain a new significance in the mid-1980s, with the result that the second generation of avowedly minimalist authors were considered to be behind the times.The literary content of minimalist texts is still debated by critics today. On the one hand, minimalist authors are accused of producing inchoate, unimaginative and banal fragments that are deficient in substance and possess no originality. On the other hand, proponenets of minimalist literature see the same characteristics--the revisiting of everyday life and dethroning of meticulous literary composition--as the manifestation of a kind of minimalist art and of a minimalist aesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Minimalism is "[...] the idea that ,in art at least, less is more".In John Barth's analysis of the concept of Minimalism, published in the 'New York Times' in 1986, Barth tries to distinguish between different usages of the term and to establish the criteria for considering a literary work to be minimalist. We must, however, bear in mind that his definition relates primarily to the concept of literary Minimalism as understood in North America in the period between 1980 and 1986.</p>
<p>"There are minimalisms of unit, form and scale: short words, short sentences and paragraphs, super-short stories, those three-eight inch thin novels afore-mentioned, and even minimal bibliographies [...].There are minimalisms of style: a stripped-down vocabulary; a stripped down syntax that avoids periodic sentences, serial predications and complex subordinating constructions; a stripped-down, non-emotive tone. And there are minimalisms of material: minimal characters, minimal exposition [...], minimal mises en scene, minimal action, minimal plot."</p>
<p>As well as listing the characteristics of Minimalism and dividing them into 'formal', 'stylistic' and 'contentual' characteristics, Barth also emphasizes that Minimalism may be one of a number of non-mutually exclusive qualities of a literary work solely as a minimalist work. After all, two individual works with stylistic similarities might exhibit any number of differences in terms of content, conception or genre.</p>
<p>Three years after this article appeared, Kim A. Herzinger published an even more extensive catalogue of characteristics. Generally accepted as authoritative at the time, Herzinger's text is still used as the basis for enumerations and definitions of the parameters of Minimalism (which are frequently contradictory of one another) to this day.</p>
<p>"Minimalist fiction is<br> a) formally spare, terse, trim; b) tonally cool, detached, noncommittal, 'flat',affectless,recalcitrant,deadpan,laconic; c) oblique and elliptical; d) relatively plotless; e) concerned with surface detail, particularly with recognizable brand names; f) depthless; g) comparatively oblique about personal, social, political, or cultural history; h) often written in the present tense; i) often written in the first person; j) sometimes written in the second person."</p>
<p>In addition to these formal criteria, Herzinger also looked at the intention of the author, the function of Minimalism and shared elements of content in minimalist short stories. For instance, he asserts that Minimalism's characteristic preponderance of trivial detail is not a form of irony or social criticism. In fact, he argues, quite the reverse is true--the neutrality of minimalist descriptive prose gives the mundane and quotidian--which a reader expects the author to portray critically and ironically -- new meaning and opens it up for re-evaluation. The author may deploy a neutral narrator figure who makes no value judgements and whose level of understanding is generally identical with that of the reader, meaning that the reader and the narrator are effectively on the same level. The author leaves it up to the reader to make judgements about the plot and characters; he or she does not imply any knowledge differential or impose any precepts by which readers should interpret the texts. This automatically changes the sender-receiver relationship and the author's perception of his or her own role--he or she is no longer a moralist, critic or psychologist. According to Herzinger, readers should view the characters in the same way as they view the people they encounter in real life--who,similarly, do not necessarily reveal all their thoughts,feelings,opinions and perspectives. Each reader can judge the characters for themselves in an unbiased way.<br>The neutral narrative style has the additional function of allowing the narrator to create a certain distance between himself or herself and the action. For instance, he or she can describe emotional developments coolly and objectively, avoiding making judgements and sometimes even allowing important developments to be pushed into the background by trivial and incidental matters, or mentioningg them only in passing and with apparent disinterest. This restart sometimes create a certain laconic humour, or awakens paradoxical feelings in the reader. In spite of this, minimalist narratives are not ironic depictions of everyday life—the intention is not to hold the characters up to ridicule, and, similarly, their environment is treated with respect. Readers are given the impression that the narrative is leading up to an ironic point of some kind, but they are eventually forced to realize that it is not, and the non-fulfillment of their expectations has the effect of alienating them from the familiar and predictable.</p>
<p><strong>Text-immanent features</strong></p>
<p>The content of minimalist texts is, as a matter of principle, heavily reduced. As a result, they are dominated by individual situations or episodes, which carry more meaning than the actual plot narrative. The content generally consists of everyday subjects, with cultural, social and political themes touched on only briefly or excluded entirely. The absence of an introduction, a clearly defined climax or an ending-in other words, of a dramatic structure—creates an effect of “narrative permanence”. The recipient is given no introductory explanations, there are no logical consequences to the events of the story, and the conclusion is generally ambiguous, with ‘happy endings’ actively discriminated against. This patchy narrative style has two major implications: it obliges the reader to fill in the gaps cognitively, and it compensates for the reduction of tension created by the lack of dramatic structure by providing a new source of interest. Because the narrative generally takes place in the present moment and covers only a small number of locations, the dimensions of time and space play a limited role. Every single moment, every event and every episode can be taken to represent a whole life in microcosm.</p>
<p>Minimalist literature has not remained confined to a set of stylistic criteria which apply principally to the North American context-the parameters have been frequently rewritten or modified by a variety of authors, and recent years have seen the debate on the Minimalism concept extending into European academic circles. In addition, the term ‘Minimalism’ is now no longer applied solely to the short story genre--a number of academic works have analyzed Minimalism in novels and plays.</p>
<p><strong>A historical overview</strong></p>
<p>Modernism did not invent the strategy of using brevity to make forms of expression more forceful and effective—countless sayings such as ‘less is more’,’short and sweet’ and ‘silence is golden’ demonstrate that this strategy has existed for centuries. Equally, theories of the short story propounded by authors of previous eras-from Edgar Allan Poe to Samuel Beckett and Ernest Hemingway—are compatible with the fundamental tenets of modern minimalist theory in that they assert that everything superfluous must be eliminated in order to give more meaning to the story’s essential substance.</p>
<p>In 1846, Edgar Allan Poe composed an essay entitled <i>The Philosophy of Composition</i>. Primarily, it explains the genesis of his poem The Raven, 1846, but it also contains his thoughts on literary theory—and, in particular, on the correct length for poems. He criticizes poems that are too long to be read at one sitting because they do not fulfill the requirement of unity, going on to say that a poem’s ability to connect with the reader’s inner life and to thereby intensively agitate the psyche is a measure of its quality. This pitch of intensity, however, can only be painted for a limited period of time, with the result that any work whose length exceeds this and forces readers to break off and return at a later stage will inevitably leave them fundamentally unmoved.</p>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe extends this theory and makes it relevant to prose. Like the minimalist theories of over 100 years later, he counsels against the use of superfluous words.”Undue Brevity is just as exceptionable here [note: in a tale] as in a poem; but undue length is yet more to be avoided.”</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway compared the content of short stories with the structure of an iceberg. Just as seven-eights of the iceberg’s substance lies below the surface of the water, for every “visible” (i.e. written) element of the story’s content that an author reveals, he should leave far more unsaid, leaving it to the reader’s imagination. In fact, Hemingway explicitly indicates that the art of writing a reduced narrative is to know where to leave an empty space— to painstakingly select the elements that should be left out.</p>
<p>“If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eight of it being above water.”</p>
<p>The short story form presents the closest parallels with the principles of minimalist writing—after all, Minimalism has its origins in a short story writing style—but there are other literary art forms that could be described as minimalist, such as palindromes, ambigrams, aphorisms and Japanese haiku. Writers of lyrical poetry in particular often experiment with reduction. This has been the case ever since the classical age: the art of rhetoric, for instance, named simplicity, clarity, brevity and economy as its ideals. These principles became assimilated into art theory, which propounded the ideal of simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Illustrative analysis of a minimalist play</strong></p>
<p>The distinguishing features of minimalist literature are listed in the accompanying mind map: reduction of form, of style, of content and of characterization. The defining characteristics of Minimalism that come under each of these headings provide both the basis and the structure for the following analysis. This investigation aims to reveal which of these features apply in this case, as well as the contexts in which minimalist stylistic elements are deployed. Of course, in reality it is not necessary for al these factors to be present in order for a work to be classed as minimalist, and this representation does not reflect whether the work is minimalist in its overall effect.</p>
<p>For my analysis here, I have chosen the play <i>Das wudnervolle Zwischending</i> by Martin Heckmanns. In this play, published in 2005, Heckmann depicts a period of time in the lives and the relationship of artist couple Anne and Johann, who have been together for seven years and occasionally find their relationship monotonous. They react to this by deciding to create a film about their past partnership, in the hope of rediscovering their love and the excitement of their early days together. At the same time, they are engaged in a battle with Bertram, the ‘man from the office’,to secure more social benefits. The couple, who are unemployed and have no children, must find a meaning to their existence—and must also justify it to society, in the form of the social services authority. The main theme of both the play and the film is the relationship between Anne and Johann-a patchwork of love and hate,conflicts and reconciliations, dominated by their efforts to evade the threat of boredom.</p>
<p><strong><i>Form</i></strong></p>
<p>The play is very short. The script is 31 pages long, and there are only three actors. Aside from the many sub-chapters, it is loosely divided into seven acts. Each act corresponds precisely to a single day, meaning that the play covers a timespan of a week and a real-time duration of approximately three quarters of an hour. This is made possible by frequent gaps in the narrative, which frequently skips forward in time: each ‘day’ is presented to the audience in the form of a few brief sequences. The chapter headings generally allow us to identify these shifts forward in time. There is a recurring structure-a brief everyday sequence, then a gap, with the next sub-chapter following directly on without a break. One of these, for instance, is entitled ‘Das Geful Mega’ (‘the mega feeling’), and deals with the decline of passion in the relationship. It ends with both characters wanting to sleep with each other. The actual sexual act is passed over,and the next chapter, entitled ‘Post coitum’,presents their dialogue after the sexual union. One feature of this structure is that intimate scenes are deliberately omitted.</p>
<p>There is no explanatory introduction, no recognizable climax and no final resolution. Additionally, it is not always clear to readers whether they are seeing the characters living their everyday lives or acting in the film-a compositional device that is consistent with minimalist principles.</p>
<p>The language used in the play is not consistently reduced, but the typical minimalist fragmented phrases, short and simple sentences, pauses and repetitions do feature prominently. This can be seen in the following night-time monologue, spoken by Anne:</p>
<p>Anne: <i>initially accusing</i> Yes, yes, you. Yes, you. I mean. You like that. Yes, yes. Great. <i>Pause.</i> You, ok. I mean, me too, I can’t either, you have to. I mean, you too. <i>Pause.</i> Together. <i>Pause.</i> I am, after all. After all, we are. Or were. Or no? <i>Pause.</i> You and me. Come on. Us. I have to. You have to. We can. Together. Future. Eh? <i>Pause.</i> Are you asleep?[…].</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p>The vocabulary used in the play is very varied and generally appropriate to the situation. It includes passages of simple language and everyday vocabulary and deploys a mixture of correct German and everyday informal speech. The ends of verbs, for instance, may be omitted:</p>
<p>Johann: Anne?</p>
<p>Anne: Hm.</p>
<p>Johann: I’m afraid.</p>
<p>Anne: Hm.</p>
<p>Johann: I can’t do it.</p>
<p>Anne: Hm.</p>
<p>The exchanges between the couple and the social services officer are dominated by the intellectual phrases they use to distance themselves from society. These conversations have a comparatively wide vocabulary, with the characters generally speaking in complete sentences and engaging with the dialogue to a much greater degree. Both protagonists see themselves as independent, intellectual artists.</p>
<p>Anne: You are a representative of the neoliberal bio-power. Do not enter our home.</p>
<p>Another strategy the couple deploy in order to distance themselves from society is to confuse people they talk to. For instance, they pretend to have a child, and when the officer asks where the child is, they initially mislead him by saying that the child is asleep. This simultaneously confuses the reader, and clarity is not restored until Bertram, the official, is enlightened.</p>
<p>The syntax is paratactic, with many incomplete sentences that are either interrupted by the other dialogue partner or simply tail off. The play begins with the following piece of dialogue, which ends with Johann realizing, with disappointment, that Anne and himself know everything about each other and can no longer surprise one another. The interruptions reinforce the male protagonist’s assertion.</p>
<p>Anne: Today-</p>
<p>Johann: Don’t tell me.</p>
<p>Anne: In a queue at the social security office-</p>
<p>Johann: Please don’t tell me.</p>
<p>Anne: Right out of the blue-</p>
<p>Johann: I don’t want to know.</p>
<p>Anne: I met Ulli.</p>
<p>Johann: Why did you tell me that? I knew before you said it I wouldn’t be interested.</p>
<p>The language style of the play, then, has many minimalist features, although not all of these are consistently present. As I have demonstrated, some passages feature complex sentences with a more extensive vocabulary. The same is true of characterization and forms of expression in the play. Extremely strong emotions are expressed verbally—when Anne tells Johann she could hate him, for instance. These expressions of emotion, however, are abruptly undermined by a lack of response from the other partner in the conversation, who immediately changes the subject back to something trivial—revealing to us the lack of passion in the couple’s lives. As a result, the characterization appears monotonous and inexpressive in some sequences, and startling and dramatic in others.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>The play has two parallel plots: it describes the couple’s everyday lives and their efforts to create a film, but the events of the film also play a major role. These twin strands of the plot impact on each other, and we are sometimes unable to distinguish clearly between them.</p>
<p>The play’s main theme is the romance and relationship between the couple. It also addresses sociopolitical themes, such as the lives of social benefits recipients and those who accept single-euro jobs. The everyday problems o this section of society, however, are only addressed in passing and superficially, with the focus of the play quickly returning to everyday situations that are primarily non-political.</p>
<p>Most of the action of the play takes place in the couple’s home, with one brief section taking place in the supermarket. The stage directions contain barely any descriptions of the individual settings, and barely list any props. At most, they may briefly mention that the two protagonists are seated at the breakfast table. Placing the action within the private sphere creates a sense of intimacy that is unusual in a minimalist play. The dialogue shows us moments of happiness and moments of conflict within the protagonists’ relationship. Very few words are devoted to such intense moments, as is demonstrated by the play’s unresolved conclusion—during which Johann sings a specially composed love-song for Anne.</p>
<p>Anne:You wrote that specially for me?</p>
<p>Johann:Yes.</p>
<p>Anne:Although it’s all over with us?</p>
<p>Johann:Yes.</p>
<p>Anne:You know it’s all over with us?</p>
<p>Johann:Yes.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Anne:Is that the end?</p>
<p>Johann:Yes.</p>
<p>Anne:The end of the film?</p>
<p>Johann:  So what do we do now?</p>
<p>Up until this point, the couple have never discussed ending their relationship. IT is left to the reader to decide whether this is the end of the relationship, or merely the end of the film.</p>
<p><strong>Characters.</strong></p>
<p>The play has only three characters: the couple—Johann und Anne—and the ‘officer’,Bertram. Anne mentions once that her eyes are green, and Johann claims that his second name is Berger, but apart from this we are told nothing about the characters—there are no further indications as to their age or appearance. Anne and Johann are artists and intellectuals who see themselves as having nothing in common with the world around them. Johann, for instance, is annoyed when Annie tells him that she has show the film to people in order to attract financial support, as he wants to avoid the film becoming a commercial project. Both are without income, living in social housing and dependent on benefits. They refuse to enter into long-term responsibilities or obligations—this is revealed to the reader by sequences such as their discussion concerning children.</p>
<p>In the supermarket section, the reader further learns that the couple previously had more money, and were probably also more successful. At the time during which the play is set, they could be considered to belong to an underclass, as they are wholly dependent on social support. They also appear to suffer from a lack of direction, and to have no plans for the future. All in all, they are simple and mediocre artists who present themselves to the outside world as intellectual and egocentric, but are unable to deny the depressing barrenness of their existence in everyday home life. Even their relationship appears to be based primarily on habit-a fact that Johann in particular criticizes strongly. Aside from these issues, we learn very little about the two main characters, making it hard for recipients to identify them.</p>
<p><strong>Function and effect.</strong></p>
<p>The emphasis and repetition that are part of the minimalist style function as a means of direction the attention of the audience or reader: linguistic reduction increases the significance of individual words. The same is true of repetition: it allows details and incidental facts to become central to a play, presenting them as worthy of the recipient’s attention. Repetitions also slow down the pace of the action, creating more space for individual recipients to make their own interpretations.</p>
<p>Another function of a minimalist composition is to activate recipients. Gaps, blanks, references and, above all, unanswered questions cause us to engage with the work, to interpret it and to allow our imagination to play a part, so that we essentially construct an element of the work for ourselves. In this way, a reader or audience member becomes part of the action, both intellectually and emotionally. This way of appealing to recipients makes the work involving in spite of the absence of climaxes, the omission of spectacular scenes and its superficially tranquil and monotonous nature.</p>
<p>A further effect of the minimalist style is that—primarily due to its reduced use of language-it creates an impression of extreme realism. The reduced language deployed in the dialogue appears consistent with standard everyday speech,which rarely includes complete sentences. That we do not know everything about the people we are seeing and that emotions may be suppressed is also consistent with our everyday experience. Drastic reduction of language, however, can also produce the opposite effect, making the work appears stylized, with the aim no longer to create a sense of realism, but to make recipients feel distanced from the work and its protagonists. Characters appear inaccessible, and the action has no commentary. The result is that recipients observe and evaluate events in a neutral way.</p>
<p><strong>Resume</strong></p>
<p>The term ‘Minimalism’, borrowed from other branches of the arts, became current in a literary context in the 1980s (particularly in the USA), being used to describe short stories in a highly reduced style. The defining characteristics of minimalist literature were subsequently refined and differentiated, and extended to other genres. The phenomenon has since spread beyond North America, primarily to northern Europe.</p>
<p>All definitions and sets of criteria agree that Minimalism is a quality of style.Minimalist works feature formal, linguistic,stylistic and contentual reduction. Authors deploy these minimalist stylistic elements in order to activate recipients, who are encouraged to respond through the nature of the work. Selective emphasis and omission can also be a means of directing recipients’ attention, as my analysis of Martin Heckmanns’ play <i>Das wundervolle Zwischending</i> demonstrates. Minimalist works appear realistic and objectively presented, although, given that they are also conceived to elicit audience response and manipulate audience attention, this is merely an impression.</p>
